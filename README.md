This is a News Web Page created by me, the reason i built this is to fulfill my P3 2nd semester project in my 1st year 
wherein we have to build a static webpage using only html and css. That's why there is just minimal js on my project 
overall the aim of my project is to connect with people and inforrm them of what is happening around us.

PS. This project was solely built by a freshman student that is new on web development so please no hate âœŒ
